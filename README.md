# Pathfinding Algorithms on a Graph

This project demonstrates the use of different pathfinding algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford) on a graph parsed from an XML file containing nodes and arcs. The graph is visualized using `matplotlib` and allows users to interactively select start and end nodes, and then visualize the shortest path calculated by Dijkstra or Bellman-Ford algorithms.

## Features

- **Node Parsing**: Extracts node information (ID, longitude, latitude) from an XML file.
- **Arc Parsing**: Extracts arc information (from node, to node, length) from the same XML file.
- **Graph Creation**: Constructs an undirected graph using NetworkX, where nodes and edges (arcs) are added.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Finds the shortest path between two nodes using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.
- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**: Computes the shortest path and detects negative weight cycles.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Allows the user to select start and end nodes through mouse clicks, and visualizes the computed shortest path in the graph.
